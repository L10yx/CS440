This is the module you'll submit to the autograder.

There are several function definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.  You should replace
each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

'''
Extra Credit: define the strategy for a sequential game.

sequential_strategy[a,b] is the probability that your player will perform action 1
on the next round of play if, during the previous round of play, 
the other player performed action a, and your player performed action b.

Examples:
* If you want to always act uniformly at random, return [[0.5,0.5],[0.5,0.5]]
* If you want to always perform action 1, return [[1,1],[1,1]].
* If you want to return the other player's action (tit-for-tat), return [[0,0],[1,1]].
* If you want to repeat your own previous move, return [[0,1],[0,1]].
* If you want to repeat your last move with probability 0.8, and the other player's last move 
with probability 0.2, return [[0.0, 0.8],[0.2, 1.0]].
